branch: ge11
includes all GE1/1 logic. Currently the main branch

branch: upgraded-TMB-format-full-rework
full rework of the MPCX format according to upgraded TMB format. LCT0 and LCT1 have different formats. After this rework, the code did not fit timing, in GMT CRC of all places, even though technically no difference from old LCT format was inserted yet, just signal names changed. Laid off for now.
